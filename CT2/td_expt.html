    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>This project uses TouchDesigner to explore digital materiality by generating 2D image textures, observing the similarities and differences between digital and physical artifacts. It focuses on four key aspects: Permutation, Intention, Complexity, and Control, while documenting observations throughout the creation process</p>

        <h2>My Idea</h2>
        <p>In this project, I explored a wide variety of image textures, experimenting with different ways to generate and transform them. I also incorporated audio as an input at various stages to influence and animate the movement of the textures. Each time I created a basic exploration of shape and material movement, I would dive deeper into it, so each type often has more than one version.</p>

          <h2>Audio-Driven Shape Transformation</h2>
          <p>
            This project explores the use of audio input to drive the transformation and movement of 3D geometries in TouchDesigner.
            Starting with a basic sphere, I applied a noise function to distort its surface, then used real-time audio spectrum data
            to animate and influence its deformation over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each component — from geometry creation, noise distortion, to audio analysis and control — was carefully linked to build a responsive system.

          <h2>From Wireframe to Liquid Surface</h2>
          <p>
            Building on my previous audio-driven shape exploration, this new iteration adds dynamic surface textures, vivid color shifts, and richer visual layers.
            While the earlier version focused on wireframe deformation, the updated version introduces noise-based material distortion and fluid, organic motion, enhanced by vibrant purple tones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiple noise layers were added to create more depth and detail in the movement. Final outputs were captured after additional transformations and compositing, allowing the audio to influence both geometry and texture flow.

            <h2>Patterned Motion: Audio-Responsive Arrays</h2>
            <p>
            Continuing the exploration of audio-driven deformation, this version expands into patterned repetition. A single spiked structure, shaped by noise distortion and audio input, is tiled across the canvas to create a synchronized array.
            The combination of sharp forms, vibrant purple gradients, and rhythmic motion transforms the piece into a breathing, reactive field.
            </p>
            <p>
            By introducing tiling and maintaining real-time audio control, the system highlights the beauty of synchronized patterns and dynamic symmetry.

                Learned by a point cloud tutorialhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt2hwb5cngA, this piece extends the original idea by integrating real-time audio-driven noise distortion.
                Each particle responds subtly to sound frequencies, creating an evolving symmetrical field that breathes and flows with the music.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond the basic setup, additional transformations and noise layers were customized to enrich the motion, making the entire system more dynamic and alive.

              <p>
                Building on the previous particle system, this version introduces a secondary layer of background particles.
                Reacting to the rhythm of the music, these particles subtly converge toward the center, creating a breathing, gravitational effect that deepens the spatial experience.
              </p>

                By layering multiple reactive fields, the piece achieves a richer dynamic symmetry and a stronger sense of immersive motion driven entirely by sound.

                Expanding on a classroom exercise originally based on simple displacement techniques, this project introduces a playful twist by replacing the original banana image with a cat figure.
                The cat's form is dynamically distorted by real-time audio input, while layered gradients and circular compositions build a dreamy, rhythmic background.

              <p>
                Inspired by the recent viral "OIIA Cat," this evolution of the cat displacement project focuses on enhancing fluid motion and softness.

              <p>
                This project marks an important starting point in my exploration of audio-reactive design. 
                Using a simple torus wireframe as the base, I experimented with mapping audio spectrum data to geometry deformation, learning how to control movement through nodes like Analyze, Select, and Math. 
                Although visually minimal, the process of refining audio-driven motion through trial and error became a crucial foundation for all the more complex works that followed.

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on creating an original video game and a custom controller through hands-on experimentation.
            It explores the technical components of gameplay, including coding physics, designing player goals, and connecting hardware to software.
            The final deliverable includes a live webpage showcasing the game concept, mechanics, videos of gameplay, and feedback from playtesters.</p>

        <h2>My Idea</h2>
        <p>I wanted to create a simple jumping game, inspired by a rhythm game I played before.
            Unlike Mario, my game moves forward at a steady speed, and the only control is jumping to survive.
            Starting from a 2D block prototype, I developed it into a cat adventure game—where jumping onto sofas and floors is safe, but falling into a pet carrier means getting locked up and sent for shots, ending the game.</p>

          <h2>Player First</h2>
          <p>
            I started by setting up a new 2D project in Unity using the Built-in Render Pipeline.
For the player character, I created a simple 2D square object and applied a Sprite Renderer component to make it visible with a color.
Next, I prepared to add a Rigidbody2D component to give the player basic physics properties like gravity and movement.
My overall approach was to first establish the game logic using basic geometric shapes, ensuring the system runs smoothly before replacing them with the final character artwork.

          <h2>Basic Logic</h2>
          <p>
            In the next step, I set up the basic logic for the player block.
I added a Rigidbody2D component to make the block dynamic and affected by gravity, allowing it to fall naturally.
I also attached a BoxCollider2D so the player can properly interact with platforms and obstacles through collision detection.
With these two components, the block now has both physics simulation and collision behavior, establishing the foundation for jumping and movement in the game.

          <h2>Test #1</h2>
          <p>
            After setting up the Rigidbody2D and BoxCollider2D components, I ran an initial logic test for the player block.
The goal was to check if the block would properly respond to gravity, fall onto platforms, and detect collisions without passing through objects.
This test confirmed that the basic physics behaviors were functioning correctly, laying the groundwork for adding jumping and obstacle interactions next.

          <h2>Movement</h2>
          <p>
            After verifying the basic physics setup, I wrote a control script for the player.
The script had two main goals: first, to move the player automatically toward the right at a steady speed; second, to allow the player to jump when triggered.
This established the core movement system for the game, where the player is constantly advancing and must time their jumps carefully to avoid obstacles.

          <h2>Camera</h2>
          <p>
            In the next step, I focused on setting up the camera behavior.
I wrote a script to make the Camera follow the player's horizontal movement smoothly.
However, the Camera only advances if the player moves forward — if the player gets stuck or stops, the Camera remains stationary, preventing unfair scrolling.
This ensures that the player's progress feels natural and that the screen space always matches the actual gameplay pace.

          <h2>Rule</h2>
          <p>
            Next, I introduced two types of environment elements: safe platforms and danger zones.
I added collidable platforms that the player can jump onto and land safely, enabling more complex movement challenges.
I also created red danger zones that the player must avoid — touching these areas could later trigger a Game Over condition.
After setting up these elements, I tested the interactions to ensure proper collision behavior and smooth jumping across platforms.

          <h2>Route</h2>
          <p>
            After setting up the basic environment, I moved on to building the playable route.
            I designed a sequence of platforms and danger zones, carefully arranging their positions and distances.
            I tested the route multiple times, adjusting jumps and obstacle placements to make sure the game felt balanced — challenging but not frustrating, and engaging without being too easy.

          <h2>Styling</h2>
          <p>
            Once the basic gameplay and level structure were stable, I replaced the placeholder graphics with the final visual elements.
I swapped the player block for a cat character, changed the safe platforms into soft-looking sofas and floors, and replaced the danger zones with pet carriers.
These new visuals bring the story to life, making the gameplay experience more charming and connected to the game's world.

              <p>
                To wrap up the project, I recorded a full playthrough of the game.
This final video shows the complete experience — from the steady forward movement, to timed jumps onto sofas and floors, to the final consequence of falling into a pet carrier.
It demonstrates how the initial concepts, mechanics, and visual elements come together into a cohesive and playable game.

              <h2>Problem Still Working On</h2>
              <p>
                I attempted to set up an external button to control jumping in Unity via an ESP32 board.
Initially, I used a pressure sensor — the data was stable and correctly displayed in Arduino Serial Monitor, but I couldn't successfully receive the input in Unity.
I switched to a simple physical button for testing, and although the button press was detected properly in Arduino, Unity still did not respond to the input.
The issue might be related either to the Unity-side script for reading serial data, or to the communication link between Arduino and Unity.

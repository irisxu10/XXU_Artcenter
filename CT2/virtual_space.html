        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>This project starts by sketching the dream space, considering its environment, objects, layout, and possible interactions. The sketches can be created on paper or digitally, and should be annotated for documentation.</p>
        <p>Once a clear idea is formed, the environment can be built using tools like Unity's terrain tool, with interactions added. Built-in physics should also be incorporated if applicable.</p>
        <p>This documentation will outline the entire process of designing and building my virtual island, with a focus on interaction and the environmental layout. </p>

        <h2>My Idea</h2>
        <p>My idea is to create a small island similar to the one I have in the game called "Animal Crossing." I truly enjoy the relaxed pace of the game, where I can fish, plant trees, and build houses. However, the game requires a significant time investment, so I haven’t been able to keep up. That’s why I want to try and build a prototype of my imagined island in Unity, to see how much of the experience I can replicate.</p>

              <h2>First Step - Terrain Adjustment</h2>
              <p><strong>❌</strong> I initially tried to raise the areas I needed above the sea level, but this resulted in a very uneven surface and made it impossible to maintain consistent height across the terrain. Instead of raising the high areas, I decided to lower the lower areas.</p>
              <p><strong>✅</strong> So, I began by creating a flat surface with some height and lowering the surrounding areas to simulate a beach where it meets the sea. Next, I lowered certain areas to create riverbeds. Finally, I raised a portion of the largest land area to create a small hill.</p>
              <p>After spending a lot of time adjusting the terrain, I finally achieved the desired landscape. <strong>Having a flat terrain with slight height differences was more challenging for me than creating large mountains.</strong></p>
              <p>Next, I started painting textures onto the terrain. I created multiple layers including different grasses, soils, mud, and sand. This helped make the terrain look more natural, with the slopes, riverbeds, and beaches near the water blending seamlessly into the environment.</p>

              <h2>Adding Plants and Water</h2>
              <p>After adjusting the terrain, I began to decorate the island by adding various plants. I included grass, bushes, and coconut trees typical of the island, as well as many aquatic flowers and grasses that grow in the island's freshwater areas. These plants helped bring life and color to the environment.</p>
              <p>Additionally, I added the ocean water surrounding the island. This created a natural border and enhanced the realistic feel of the island, making it feel more immersive and lively.</p>

              <h2>Building Structures on the Island</h2>
              <p>After decorating the island with plants and water, I began building structures. I downloaded and imported some basic materials and started constructing. I built small bridges between different areas of the island, and I created a small wooden house, which is divided into four parts: the floor, walls, roof, and ladder. Alongside the house, I also built a small tent with a storage box behind it.</p>
              <p>One of the challenges I faced during this step was constantly adjusting the size, direction, and angles of many objects. This took a lot of time, effort, and patience, as everything needed to fit perfectly in the environment.</p>

              <h2>Progress on the Island</h2>
              <p>
                <p>At this point, the island has started to take shape. I’ve built a small living space with the wooden house and a second base with the tent and storage box. The bridges connecting the different areas have created a more connected environment, making the island feel more like a functional space. It's rewarding to see everything come together, as it now has places to live and a second operational base.</p>
                <p>However, there is still more to be done. There’s a lot of work left to improve the details and add more interaction. The island is starting to feel more like a real place, but I still need to focus on the finer details, such as adding objects, refining the terrain, and potentially adding gameplay elements for interactivity.</p>
                <p>Despite the challenges, it's been an exciting journey, and I'm looking forward to expanding this small world further. The next steps will involve creating more areas, possibly adding more buildings or even a larger main structure. I also want to experiment with different gameplay elements, like NPC interactions or new environmental effects.</p>

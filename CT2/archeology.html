        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>This project began with a speculative design prompt:
        Imagine a future world and create an object that exists within it using Blender.</p>
        <p>We were first asked to map our imagined future on a conceptual axis — defining its values, priorities, and power structures (e.g. technology vs. nature, individualism vs. collectivism). From there, we developed a design idea that reflects this world’s logic and aesthetic.</p>
        <p>The final output is a 3D-modeled object that represents how design might look, feel, and function in that future context.</p>

            <h2>My Idea</h2>
            <p>My idea is to create a small island similar to the one I have in the game called "Animal Crossing." I truly enjoy the relaxed pace of the game, where I can fish, plant trees, and build houses. However, the game requires a significant time investment, so I haven’t been able to keep up. That’s why I want to try and build a prototype of my imagined island in Unity, to see how much of the experience I can replicate.</p>

            <h2>Framing</h2>
            <p>First, I used a conceptual axis to define the direction I wanted to explore. I also gathered some visual and thematic references along the way.</p>

            <h2>First Step - Refining the Shape</h2>
            <p>Next, I began refining the shape by using modifiers in Blender. I started with a Mirror Modifier to work symmetrically, allowing me to model only half of the object while keeping it balanced.</p>
            <p>Then I explored other modifiers like Bevel, Subdivision Surface, and Solidify to gradually shape the base form of the meditation device, adding smoothness and volume.</p>

            <h2>Shaping the Form</h2>
            <p>I continued refining the shape using Subdivision Surface to create a smooth and organic body. I then selected and modified specific faces to form a central cut or indentation, which later becomes the holographic projection area of the AI Meditation Stone.</p>

            <h2>Creating the Core</h2>
            <p>I added a sphere and adjusted its position and rotation to fit the shape of the meditation stone. This object is used to form the inner cavity — the place where light, symbols, or spiritual energy would be projected.</p>
        </div>

    <section class="projects">
        <div class="project-text">
            <h2>Sensors</h2>
            <p>I added two oval-shaped sensing areas designed for the user’s thumbs. These zones serve as biometric and emotional input points, allowing the AI Meditation Stone to read stress levels, heart rate, and spiritual focus through direct contact.</p>

            <h2>Material Setup</h2>
            <p>At the heart of the AI Meditation Stone, I created a liquid-crystal-like surface — something that feels fluid like water yet clear and reflective like crystal.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Lighting & Environment</h2>
            <p>I added an HDRI background and adjusted the lighting to make the object more visible in context. The soft reflections help show the surface material more clearly, especially the liquid-like crystal area. This step also helps to better present the overall form and feel of the device.</p>
